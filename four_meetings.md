# Scrum has Four Meetings:

### 1. Sprint Planning
* Product Owner presents READY backlog to Scrum Master and Team
* Deliverable is Sprint Backlog
### 2. Daily Scrum
* Team self-organizes to improve performance
* Deliverable is new daily plan for implementation and impediment
removal
### 3. Sprint Review
* Team presents backlog that is DONE to Product Owner and Stakeholders
* Deliverable is velocity (what Product Owner confirms is DONE), feedback
(used to update Product Backlog), and potentially shippable Product
Increment
### 4.Retrospective
* Scrum Master and team identify the top process improvement
* Deliverable is the KAIZEN to put at top of Sprint Backlog for next Sprint
